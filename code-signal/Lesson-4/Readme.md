# Time and Space Complexity of Stack Operations.

Let's unravel the complexities (pun intended!) behind these Stack operations. All three of our basic operations — push, pop, and peek — have a time complexity of O(1),
meaning they take constant time to complete, regardless of the size of the Stack.

Contrarily, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the Stack.
This is considering an average scenario where elements are continually added and then removed from the Stack.
