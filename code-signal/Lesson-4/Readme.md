# Time and Space Complexity of Stack Operations.

- Let's unravel the complexities (pun intended!) behind these Stack operations.
- All three of our basic operations — push, pop, and peek — have a time complexity of O(1),
- meaning they take constant time to complete, regardless of the size of the Stack.

Contrarily, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the Stack.
This is considering an average scenario where elements are continually added and then removed from the Stack.

# Time and Space Complexity of Queue Operations.

- Python lists, however, have a significant drawback: the pop(0) method has O(n) time complexity, while we would like it to be O(1).
- There is another Python module named collections that offers deque, a flexible container that serves both as queue and stack implementations.

_Queues can be more versatile than they might seem at first glance._

- For instance, in Graph theory, the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm makes extensive use of Queues
- to check nodes across levels in the correct order in a graph traversal problem.
