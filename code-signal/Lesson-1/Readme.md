- Collision Handling: Explore techniques to manage hash collisions for reliable data storage.
- Complexity Analysis: Analyze the efficiency of operations to write optimized code.

## Hashing

### Definitions

- **Hash function** is a specific function that take an input (also known as a message) and return a fixed-size string of bytes.
- **Hash set** uses hash functions to point directly to the location of the interaction, making operations efficient and timely,
  thus making it preferable when you want to prevent duplicates.

### Characteristics

- `Uniqueness of elements`
- `Inherent unordered property`
