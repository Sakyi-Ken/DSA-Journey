# Master Data Structures in Python
_Lesson 1 - 6_ 
`Each Lesson contains Implementation of the data structure or algorithm in consideration with solution to some interview questions of that very data structure or algorithm.`
## Structures and Algorithms tackled are:
1. Hashmaps, Hash sets
2. Binary Search
3. Merge sort, Quick Sort and other sorting techniques
4. Stacks, Queues and LinkedList (Singly LinkedList, Circular LinkedList, Doubly LinkedList).
5. Trees (Binary trees and Non-binary trees), Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Binary Search trees and Heaps
